## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library that provides easy-to-use data structures and functions for working with structured data. It is widely used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis tasks.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Pandas, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once you have Python installed, you can install Pandas using pip:

bash `pip install pandas`
